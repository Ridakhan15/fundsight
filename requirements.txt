streamlit
pandas
requests
prophet
matplotlib


Notes:

1)prophet is the modern package name that installs via pip; if you run into build/toolchain errors you may need system C++ compilers or use conda. If that happens I can show alternatives.

2)If you use Flask instead of Streamlit, add Flask.
